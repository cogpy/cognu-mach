## Usage Examples

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes
```bash
# Fix MIG build issues across all files
./scripts/fix-mig-64bit.sh --batch-process

# Update struct size definitions globally
./scripts/fix-mig-64bit.sh --update-struct-sizes

# Verify fixes without applying changes
./scripts/fix-mig-64bit.sh --verify vm/memory_object_user.user.c
```

### Phase 2: Feature Completion
```bash
# Run extreme memory stress test
./scripts/stress-test-memory.sh --extreme-load --duration=24h

# Test SMP race conditions with 16 threads
./scripts/test-smp-memory-races.sh --cpu-count=16 --iterations=10000

# Benchmark IPC for database workload
./scripts/benchmark-ipc.sh --workload=database --duration=10m
```

### Phase 3: Enhancement & Polish
```bash
# Comprehensive system test on all platforms
./scripts/comprehensive-system-test.sh --all-platforms --full-coverage

# Validate performance targets with all benchmarks
./scripts/validate-performance-targets.sh --all-benchmarks

# Complete documentation validation
./scripts/validate-documentation.sh --completeness-check --strict

# Assess research components for production
./scripts/validate-mach5-research.sh --production-assessment

# Long-term stability test (72 hours)
./scripts/test-research-components.sh --duration=72h --component=all
```

## Integration with Strategic Plan

The implemented scripts directly support the strategic plan execution:

1. **Week 1-2**: Use enhanced MIG fix scripts to resolve build system issues
2. **Week 3-6**: Execute memory stress tests and IPC benchmarks for feature completion
3. **Week 7-12**: Run comprehensive validation and research component assessment

## Next Steps

With all infrastructure implemented, the development team can now:

1. Execute the strategic plan as outlined in `NEXT_DEVELOPMENT_STEPS.md`
2. Use the comprehensive testing suite for validation
3. Assess production readiness with the validation scripts
4. Monitor progress with detailed reporting capabilities

## Validation Results

The implementation has been tested and validated:

- ✅ All scripts execute without errors
- ✅ Help documentation is comprehensive and accurate
- ✅ Error handling works correctly
- ✅ Output formatting is consistent and readable
- ✅ Integration with existing project structure is seamless

## Conclusion

The `NEXT_DEVELOPMENT_STEPS.md` strategic plan is now fully implementable with comprehensive tooling and infrastructure support. The development team has everything needed to execute the 12-week plan successfully and achieve the 95% completion target for GNU Mach development.
