## Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Weeks 1-2)
### 🎯 Goal: Achieve 100% Build Success Rate

#### **Week 1: MIG Build System Resolution**

**Day 1-2: Immediate MIG Fixes**
```bash
# Priority 1: Fix struct size assertion failures
cd /home/runner/work/cognu-mach/cognu-mach

# Update MIG wrapper for 64-bit compatibility
./scripts/fix-mig-64bit.sh --update-struct-sizes

# Check specific failing assertions
grep -n "_Static_assert.*bytes" vm/memory_object_user.user.c
# Error pattern: "Request expected to be 112 bytes" 
# Root cause: 32-bit vs 64-bit struct size differences
```

**Technical Solution**:
1. **Update Type Definitions**:
   ```c
   // In x86_64/include/mach/x86_64/machine_types.defs
   #ifdef __x86_64__
   #define REQUEST_SIZE_VM_OBJECT 112
   #else  
   #define REQUEST_SIZE_VM_OBJECT 64
   #endif
   ```

2. **Enhance MIG Wrapper**:
   ```bash
   # Modify scripts/mig-wrapper.sh
   # Add architecture detection and conditional compilation
   ```

3. **Validate Fix**:
   ```bash
   # Test both architectures
   ./configure --host=i686-gnu CC='gcc -m32' LD='ld -melf_i386'
   make clean && make
   
   ./configure --host=x86_64-gnu --enable-pae
   make clean && make
   ```

**Day 3-5: Build System Validation**
```bash
# Comprehensive build testing
scripts/ci-build.sh --force-build i686
scripts/ci-build.sh --force-build x86_64

# Validate CI pipeline
# Note: May need GitHub Actions workflow file creation
```

**Day 6-7: Documentation Update**
- Update build instructions
- Document MIG fix process
- Create troubleshooting guide

**Week 1 Success Criteria**:
- ✅ All platforms build without MIG errors
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline functional (if GitHub Actions exists)
- ✅ Build documentation updated

---

#### **Week 2: Code Quality Sprint**

**Day 8-10: Automated Code Formatting**
```bash
# Apply consistent formatting across codebase
find . -name "*.c" -o -name "*.h" | grep -v build- | xargs clang-format -i --style=GNU

# Validate no functional changes
git diff --stat  # Should show only formatting changes
```

**Day 11-12: Dead Code Removal**  
```bash
# Identify unused functions and variables
scripts/run-static-analysis.sh --comprehensive | grep -i "unused"

# Remove identified dead code systematically
# Manual review required for safety
```

**Day 13-14: Constants Consolidation**
```bash
# Consolidate duplicate constant definitions
# Focus on remaining 15% of magic numbers

# Check current status
grep -r "0x[0-9A-Fa-f]\{4,\}" kern/ | wc -l  # Count remaining magic numbers
```

**Week 2 Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Consistent code style across all source files
- ✅ Zero unused functions/variables warnings
- ✅ 95%+ constants consolidated (from current 85%)

---

## Phase 2: Feature Completion (Weeks 3-6)
### 🎯 Goal: Address Remaining Functional Gaps

#### **Week 3: Strict Aliasing Compliance**

**Technical Implementation**:
```bash
# Enable strict aliasing detection
./configure CFLAGS="-Wall -Wextra -Wstrict-aliasing=3"

# Identify violations
make 2>&1 | grep -i "aliasing"

# Common fixes needed:
# Replace union-based type punning with memcpy()
# Fix pointer casting issues
```

**Example Fix Pattern**:
```c
// Before (problematic):
union type_pun {
    uint32_t word;
    uint8_t bytes[4];
} *pun = (union type_pun*)data;
uint32_t value = pun->word;

// After (compliant):
uint32_t value;
memcpy(&value, data, sizeof(uint32_t));
```

**Week 3 Success Criteria**:
- ✅ -fstrict-aliasing compiler flag enabled
- ✅ Zero strict aliasing warnings
- ✅ No performance regression from fixes

---

#### **Week 4-5: Memory Management Hardening**

**Edge Case Testing**:
```bash
# Extended stress testing
scripts/stress-test-memory.sh --extreme-load --duration=24h

# SMP race condition testing  
scripts/test-smp-memory-races.sh --cpu-count=16 --iterations=10000

# Memory fragmentation testing
scripts/test-memory-fragmentation.sh --allocation-patterns=random
```

**Technical Improvements**:
1. **Enhanced VM Map Coalescing**:
