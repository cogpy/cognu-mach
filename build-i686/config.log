This file contains any messages produced by compilers while
running configure, to aid debugging if configure makes a mistake.

It was created by GNU Mach configure 1.8, which was
generated by GNU Autoconf 2.71.  Invocation command line was

  $ ../configure --host=i686-gnu 'CC=gcc -m32' 'LD=ld -melf_i386' MIG=mig 'CFLAGS=-g -O2'
