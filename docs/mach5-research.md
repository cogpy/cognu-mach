# Mach 5: Next-Generation Microkernel Research

This document outlines research into next-generation Mach concepts, modern microkernel architectures, and prototyping of new IPC mechanisms for GNU Mach.

## Research Objectives

### 1. Evaluate Next-Generation Mach Concepts
- **Capability-based Security**: Enhanced port-based security model
- **Zero-Copy IPC**: Elimination of unnecessary memory copies in message passing
- **Asynchronous IPC**: Non-blocking message passing mechanisms
- **Multicore Scalability**: IPC optimizations for SMP systems
- **Real-time Support**: Predictable message passing latencies

### 2. Prototype New IPC Mechanisms
- **Fast Path IPC**: Optimized common-case message passing
- **Shared Memory IPC**: Direct memory sharing between tasks
- **Vectored IPC**: Efficient handling of scattered/gathered data
- **Notification Channels**: Lightweight event signaling
- **IPC Introspection**: Enhanced debugging and monitoring

### 3. Research Modern Microkernel Architectures
- **seL4**: Formal verification and capability systems
- **Fiasco.OC**: Real-time and multicore support
- **NOVA**: Hardware-assisted virtualization
- **Genode**: Component-based OS architecture
- **Helios**: Distributed microkernel design

## Current GNU Mach IPC Analysis

### Strengths
- Mature and stable message passing interface
- Well-defined port abstraction
- Extensive device driver support through Linux compatibility

### Limitations Identified
1. **Performance**: Multiple memory copies in message passing
2. **Scalability**: Limited SMP optimization in IPC paths
3. **Security**: Basic capability model without fine-grained controls
4. **Real-time**: Non-deterministic message delivery times
5. **Debugging**: Limited introspection capabilities

## Research Areas

### A. Zero-Copy IPC Design

    A[Sender Task] --> B[Message Buffer]
    B --> C[Kernel IPC Layer]
    C --> D[Direct Memory Mapping]
    D --> E[Receiver Task]
    
    F[Traditional Copy] --> G[Sender Buffer]
    G --> H[Kernel Buffer]
    H --> I[Receiver Buffer]
```

**Objective**: Eliminate memory copies by direct page mapping for large messages.

**Research Questions**:
- How to handle partial page messages efficiently?
- What are the security implications of shared memory IPC?
- How to maintain message atomicity with zero-copy?

### B. Capability Enhancement Research

        +restrict_rights()
        +set_expiration()
    }
    
    class "Capability Revocation" as Revocation {
        +revoke_immediately()
        +revoke_recursive()
        +audit_trail()
    }
}

    class "Port Rights" as CurrentRights {
        +send_right
        +receive_right
        +send_once_right
    }
}

**Objective**: Enhance the current port-based capability system with fine-grained permissions.
