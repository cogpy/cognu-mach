### Core Components

#### 1. IPC Performance Benchmarking Framework

**Purpose**: Comprehensive benchmarking system to measure and analyze IPC performance characteristics.

**Key Features**:
- Latency measurement (round-trip time)
- Throughput analysis (messages per second)
- Bandwidth analysis (bytes per second)
- Memory usage profiling
- Scalability testing across multiple cores
- Error and timeout tracking

**API Highlights**:
```c
kern_return_t ipc_benchmark_init(ipc_benchmark_context_t *context, 
                                ipc_benchmark_type_t type, 
                                unsigned int iterations);

kern_return_t ipc_benchmark_latency(ipc_benchmark_context_t *context,
                                   ipc_message_size_t msg_size,
                                   ipc_benchmark_result_t *result);

void ipc_benchmark_print_results(const ipc_benchmark_result_t *result);
```

**Research Value**: 
- Establishes baseline performance metrics for current GNU Mach IPC
- Identifies bottlenecks in message passing paths
- Provides quantitative data for optimization efforts

#### 2. Zero-Copy IPC Prototype

**Purpose**: Prototype implementation of zero-copy IPC mechanisms to eliminate unnecessary memory copies during message passing.

**Key Concepts**:
- Page-level sharing for large messages (≥4KB)
- Direct memory mapping between tasks
- Copy-on-write (COW) support for shared data
- Scatter-gather IPC for non-contiguous data
- Asynchronous zero-copy with completion callbacks

**Design Features**:
```c
typedef struct {
    mach_msg_header_t   header;
    zcopy_message_type_t msg_type;
    unsigned int        page_count;
    vm_size_t           total_size;
    zcopy_page_desc_t   pages[ZCOPY_IPC_MAX_PAGES];
} zcopy_message_header_t;
```

**Research Value**:
- Demonstrates potential for significant performance improvements
- Addresses memory bandwidth limitations in current design
- Explores security implications of shared memory IPC

#### 3. Enhanced Capability System

**Purpose**: Next-generation capability system with fine-grained permissions, delegation controls, and comprehensive auditing.

**Key Enhancements**:
- 64-bit permission mask with fine-grained controls
- Capability delegation with depth limits and expiration
- Comprehensive audit trail for security analysis
- Conditional capabilities with runtime evaluation
- Capability composition and templates

**Permission Model**:
```c
typedef enum {
    ECAP_PERM_SEND          = (1 << 0),
    ECAP_PERM_RECEIVE       = (1 << 1),
    ECAP_PERM_VM_READ       = (1 << 8),
    ECAP_PERM_VM_WRITE      = (1 << 9),
    ECAP_PERM_TASK_CREATE   = (1 << 16),
    ECAP_PERM_CAP_DELEGATE  = (1 << 32),
    // ... up to 64 permission bits
} ecap_permission_t;
```

**Research Value**:
- Addresses security limitations in current port-based model
- Enables formal verification of security properties
- Provides foundation for high-assurance system deployment
