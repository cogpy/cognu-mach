echo "The console timestamp implementation includes:"
echo "  • Multiple timestamp formats (RELATIVE, UPTIME, SIMPLE, PRECISE)"
echo "  • Boot parameter support (notimestamps, console_timestamps=on/off)"
echo "  • Runtime enable/disable functionality"
echo "  • High-resolution timing with microsecond precision"
echo "  • Thread-safe implementation with locking"
echo "  • Comprehensive test coverage"

echo
echo "Example timestamp formats:"
echo "  RELATIVE:  [123.456] Message from kernel"
echo "  UPTIME:    [123.456] Absolute uptime format"
echo "  SIMPLE:    [123.456] Simple timestamp"
echo "  PRECISE:   [123.456.789] With microsecond precision"

echo
echo "Boot parameters supported:"
echo "  notimestamps              - Disable completely"
echo "  console_timestamps=off    - Explicit disable"
echo "  console_timestamps=on     - Explicit enable"
echo "  timestamp_format=simple   - Set format to simple"
echo "  timestamp_format=precise  - Set format to precise"
echo "  timestamp_format=uptime   - Set format to uptime"
